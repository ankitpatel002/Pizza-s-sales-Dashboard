# Pizza-s-sales-Dashboard

I recently built a comprehensive pizza sales dashboard using Power BI, with data sourced from Kaggle. My goal was to capture key performance indicators (KPIs) like Total Revenue, Total Customers, Average Price, Quantity Sold, and the Types of Pizza and Category to provide a clear snapshot of the business performance.

To make the dashboard more interactive, I added several slicers, allowing for deeper dives into the data. These slicers include Day Type (weekday/weekend), Category, Size, Quantity, Ingredients, and Pizza Name. This makes it easy for users to filter and view sales trends across different dimensions.

In terms of visuals, I have two stacked column charts showing Revenue Analysis by Month and Revenue Analysis by Day. These help identify patterns in sales across different time periods. I also included a stacked bar chart to highlight Revenue Performance by Pizza Size, giving insights into which sizes are driving the most revenue.

Iâ€™ve incorporated three pie charts as well. The first one shows the distribution of revenue by Day Type (weekday vs. weekend), the second breaks down revenue by quarter (QTR), and the third shows revenue distribution by Category. These visuals offer an at-a-glance view of revenue distribution across different segments.

Lastly, I added two tables: one showing the Top 5 Best-Selling Pizzas and the other highlighting the Bottom 5 Least-Selling Pizzas. These tables are useful for quickly identifying high performers as well as underperformers, providing actionable insights for business decisions.
